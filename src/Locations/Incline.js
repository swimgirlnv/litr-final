      <p>	Cyane is so entranced by the moon she barely notices her ski coach holding 
        out the wooden torch. <i>Its face has faded, I wonder if he would still hear me if—</i></p>

      <p>Cyane looks outside her window, out upon the inky black lake surrounded by dark 
        mountains. It is a clear night, and she can see the twinkling lights of small towns 
        clustered around the shore. The moon, full and fat, hangs heavily like a center 
        spotlight over the center of the lake, illuminating the caps of the wind waves that 
        splash against the frosted boulders rimming this portion of the waterside.</p>

      <p>“Cyane.”</p>

      <p>“Oh, sorry.”</p>

      <p>Cyane grabs the torch holding it away from her face as it spits a few sparks onto 
        her mittens. Ripping her gaze away from the moon, she looks down at the snowy hill 
        before her, it's perfect. Untouched powder. The mountain has been closed the entire 
        day in preparation for the Uller Festival, and now under fierce moonlight, the hill 
        glitters in frosted silver. The lights of the lodge at the bottom have been replaced 
        by more torches, and in the flickering shadows Cyane can just make out the giant pile 
        of old skis, poles, boots, and boards that she will set alight.</p>

      <p>“Do you think we are old enough to be allowed to do this?” 
        Kore guides her own skis to settle above Cyane. Her eyes sparkle like snow in moonlight.</p>

      <p>“It's Tahoe. We can do anything.” Cyane smiles with glee as she waves her torch through 
        the air, sparks flying about and fizzing in the snow.</p>

      <p>“You lose another one?” Kore points at her own mouth with her mitten. Cyane's tongue 
        explores the newly made gap in her teeth, feeling where her smooth gum turns into mushy 
        and metallic tissue. She nods.</p>

      <p>“My dad made this awesome jump for our sled run and I ran into a tree.” Now it's Kore's 
        turn to nod.</p>

      <p>A dull roar from the crowd at the base of the hill reaches up to Cyane. She glances back 
        at her coach, who nods. Time to go.</p>
      
      <p>Pointing their skis downhill, Cyane and Kore lead the trail of children with fire down the 
        mountain, making</p>

      <p>She and Kore, hand in hand, becoming the twinkling misty spray of snow preceding an 
        avalanche. The flames sputter and flash, clinging to life upon the wooden torches as 
        the two fling themselves into the steep powder with delight, dancing on their skis as 
        if possessed by Uller himself.</p>

      <p>And then it is over, the hill conquered, and Cyane and Kore reach the frozen pile of 
        skis. Cyane looks at the moon, is he watching us two now? She grasps Kore's hand tighter 
        and throws her torch into the pile.</p>
      
      <p>“Please don’t ever leave me.”</p>
