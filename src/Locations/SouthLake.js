      <h3>South Lake Tahoe</h3>
      
      <p>The interior of the car smells of spaghetti. Cyane looks hungrily at the culprit: 
        take-out Italian in warm foil pans, steam rising deliciously from their tops and 
        fogging up the passenger window. Cyane chews on her seat belt, letting saliva wet 
        the fabric fully before sucking back the spit with fervor. Her dad sits up front, 
        slowly navigating the winding icy road along the side of the lake while humming along 
        to their favorite opera, The Magic Flute.</p>

      <p>Cyane looks outside her window, out upon the inky black lake surrounded by dark 
        mountains. It is a clear night, and she can see the twinkling lights of small towns 
        clustered around the shore. The moon, full and fat, hangs heavily like a center 
        spotlight over the center of the lake, illuminating the caps of the wind waves that 
        splash against the frosted boulders rimming this portion of the waterside.</p>

      <p>Cyane tells the moon it is hers.</p>

      <p>The face in the moon sharpens and its eye winks.</p>

      <p>Cyane presses her face against the window, her quick breaths fogging up the glass. 
        Outside, swirls of snow emerge from the forest, leaping alongside the car. They must 
        hear the opera music, as they laugh and tumble in time with the music. One stays close 
        to Cyane’s window, her eyes sparkling in the moonlight, long hair streaming behind her 
        in the wind. She smiles. Cyane smiles back.</p>

      <p>The beginning notes of the Queen of the Night aria creep into the thick marinara air with 
        trembling bowstrings, before the horns rip into the car with a jarring blast. Cyane starts,
         then leans forward to anxiously tap her father’s shoulder.</p>

      <p>“Up! Up!”</p>

      <p>He obliges, turning the volume up, and high-pitched German opera streams from the stereo. 
        Cyane doesn’t know it is German, doesn’t even know what German is, but sings along anyway, 
        matching the pitch of Erika Miklósa. The girl outside giggles and joins along, the haunting 
        whistle of wind scurrying through treetops.</p>
      <p><i>Will I see you again?</i></p>
      <p><i>Of course.</i></p>
